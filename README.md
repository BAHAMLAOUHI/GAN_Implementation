# GAN and Conditional GAN on MNIST Dataset

In this repository, we implemented both the **Generator** and **Discriminator** for a **GAN** and a **Conditional GAN** on the MNIST dataset.

The project demonstrates:
- Generation of handwritten digits using GAN.
- Conditional generation of specific digits using Conditional GAN.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9), each 28x28 pixels.

## Features
- Implementation of both Generator and Discriminator models.
- Training process for GAN and Conditional GAN to produce realistic images.
